You probably flipped a bunch of files just by opening the repo in WSL (line-endings/permissions). Let’s clean it safely.

Quick fix (safe + reversible)
# 0) Make a safety backup of everything you’ve changed
git stash push -u -m "backup before cleanup"

# 1) Fix common WSL noise so it doesn’t happen again
git config core.filemode false
git config core.autocrlf input

# 2) Put your branch back to the last commit on it
git reset --hard HEAD

# 3) (optional) If git still shows untracked junk, preview then delete
git clean -fdxn   # preview
git clean -fdx    # delete untracked/ignored files


Now git status should be clean.

If you want your branch to exactly match the remote base branch

Sometimes you want to discard everything and start from the latest develop (or whatever your base is):

# make sure you have the latest remote refs
git fetch origin

# replace your current branch contents with the remote branch (e.g., develop)
git reset --hard origin/develop

# remove any leftover untracked files
git clean -fdx


⚠️ This discards local work. You already stashed a backup, so if you need anything back later:
git stash list and git stash apply "stash@{0}" (or whichever index).
