Quick sanity check:

aws sts get-caller-identity


(Should show the prod account.)

1) Confirm the prod bucket name

Most teams use ics-test-prod to mirror ics-test-dev. Verify:

aws s3 ls | grep ics-test-
aws s3 ls s3://ics-test-prod/    # should list top-level prefixes


If your bucket is named slightly differently in prod, just swap that name in the commands below.

2) Set your PTAG and a source folder
PTAG="12345_57bbdce6844d41c50cadeb5adc034a812"
SRC=~/SampleData1
DST="s3://ics-test-prod/Staging/$PTAG/raw/"

3) Dry-run first (safe)
aws s3 sync "$SRC" "$DST" \
  --exclude "*" --include "*.json" --include "*.hlog" \
  --dryrun


If the file list looks right, remove --dryrun:

aws s3 sync "$SRC" "$DST" \
  --exclude "*" --include "*.json" --include "*.hlog" \
  --acl bucket-owner-full-control


sync will auto-create Staging/$PTAG/raw/ in prod.
Add more --include patterns if you want additional file types.

4) Verify in prod
aws s3 ls "$DST" --recursive --summarize


You’re done—this is the prod/Staging equivalent of what you did for dev. If aws s3 ls s3://ics-test-prod/ fails with AccessDenied, you’re still on dev creds; re-paste the prod exports and try again.
